http version history

HTTP/0.9 — The one-line protocol
there were no HTTP headers,only HTML files could be transmitted

HTTP/1.0 — Building extensibility
HTTP headers has been introduced, both for the requests and the responses, allowing metadata to be transmitted and making the
protocol extremely flexible and extensible.
With the help of the new HTTP headers, the ability to transmit other documents than plain HTML files has been added
 (thanks to the Content-Type header).

HTTP/1.1 — The standardized protocol
A connection can be reused, saving the time to reopen it numerous times to display the resources embedded into the 
single original document retrieved.
Pipelining has been added, allowing to send a second request before the answer for the first one is fully transmitted,
lowering the latency of the communication.
Chunked responses are now also supported.
Additional cache control mechanisms have been introduced.
Content negotiation, including language, encoding, or type, has been introduced, and allows a client and a server to agree
on the most adequate content to exchange.
Thanks to the Host header, the ability to host different domains at the same IP address now allows server colocation.

HTTP/2 — A protocol for greater performance
Over the years, Web pages have become much more complex, even becoming applications in their own right. The amount of
visual media displayed, the volume and size of scripts adding interactivity, has also increased: much more data is
transmitted over significantly more HTTP requests.
